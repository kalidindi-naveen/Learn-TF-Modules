VPC peering
-----------
By default, no 2 vpc's connect each other

peering will establish a connection between 2 vpc's

Note: 
- CIDR Should not be same
- A wants to connect to B --> A: requester, B: Acceptor
- VPC's can be in
            - either same region of same account
            - either different region of same account
            - either same region of different account
            - either different region of different account
- Routes should be added to subnets

VPC peering is Optional -- based on user
