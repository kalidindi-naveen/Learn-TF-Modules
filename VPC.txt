VPC
---
IP Address -- 32 bits -- 4 octets -- 4*8=32

2^32 IP Address Possible

10.0.0.0/16 means the first 2 octets are fixed or 16 bits are fixed
10.0 -- fixed, each octets range -- 0-255
/16 -- we can create 256*256=64000 resources

10.0.1.0/24
/24 -- We can create 256 resources

IGW (Internet Gateway) -- allow Internet inside Vp/-PC 
if subnet attach route to IGW then we can call them as public subnets

NAT (Network Address Translation Gateway)
private servers cant connect to Internet or cant accept connections from Internet
Note: we need to create NAT in public subnet & attach route to private subnet
Enable outbount traffic only
Disable inbound traffic 

Manual Steps
------------
create VPC
create IGW
attach IGW to VPC
create subnet 
create route table
create routes
attach route table subnet
